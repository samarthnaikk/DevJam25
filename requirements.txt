# Docker Automation System Requirements
# This file contains the Python dependencies for the Docker automation system

# Core Python libraries (these are typically included in Python standard library)
# No external dependencies required - the system uses only built-in modules:
# - subprocess (for Docker commands)
# - pathlib (for path handling)
# - logging (for logging)
# - argparse (for CLI)
# - tempfile (for temporary files)
# - os (for OS operations)
# - sys (for system operations)

# Optional: If you want to add additional features in the future
# docker>=6.0.0          # For Docker Python SDK (alternative to subprocess)
# pyyaml>=6.0            # For YAML configuration files
# click>=8.0.0           # For enhanced CLI interface
# rich>=12.0.0           # For rich text and beautiful formatting
# pytest>=7.0.0          # For testing
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0      # For test coverage

# Note: The current system is designed to work with Python standard library only
# to minimize dependencies and ensure maximum compatibility.
